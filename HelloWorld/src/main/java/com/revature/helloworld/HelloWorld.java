 * Multi Line Comment

 * Packaged are a way of organizing our code into a hierarchy
 * 
 * lower case naming convention
 * 
 * 2 types of packages
 * 
 * User-Defined (like this one we are using)
 * 
 * Built-In
 * java.lang (automatically imported)
 * 
 * Other built in packages (collections) - but these need to be manually imported
